My project is “Screen time in the daily life of a GU student”

I used the iPhone screen time feature to record all my data directly to my phone, and to save the data for use, I took screenshots of it. The screenshots I then used when manually typing in the data to a google spreadhseet, which I then exported as a CSV file. My main hypothesis was that I have the most screen time on Friday and Saturday, which turned out to be true once the project was complete. The dataset I used spans from February 13 to April 14 of 2022, and the attributes excluding the date are: total screen time, social, information and reading, entertainment, productivity and finance, and other for screen time data. All of which are/were measured in minutes.



The dependencies to run this project include:

Days of the week CSV file (days_of_week.csv)

iPhone Screen Time Data CSV file (phone_data.csv)



Anaconda 3/Pandas installed

If you want to run this program with your own screen time data, the steps include:

-Recording screen time data daily, and typing in the date and screen time data to any csv file

-Creating a csv file with the dates your screen time was recorded from, and the days of the week that match the dates

-Move both (phone_data.csv) and (days_of_week.csv) to the same folder as the program will run

-SCREEN TIME RESULTS!



My project is organized into 4 parts:
1. Importing screen time data and user input dates/category 
2. Results in tables of screen time data throughout the week (days of the week)
3. Visualizations of screen time data
4. Machine leanring, kNN, trees, predictions, and accuracy score
